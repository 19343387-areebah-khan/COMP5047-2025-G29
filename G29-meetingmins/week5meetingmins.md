## Agenda

1. Review progress from Week 4, it is week 5 consolidation week so this is our chance to check our progress and see if anyone is behind and needs help. 
2. Discuss our activity diagrams and UML diagrams and see if they fit our functional requirements.  
3. Cross-check each other’s diagrams for correctness and completeness.  
4. Discuss and clarify our use cases for UML diagrams and see if they suit  
5. Check that members are consistenly using GitHub as they do each task, and that we look at eachothers commits throughout the week as we do our own tasks to ensure cohesiveness.  
6. Assign individual tasks so everyone can try to be in the same position (ideally task 3b complete and 4a drafts) by the beginning of week 6.

- All members are using Papyrus. David has completed both UML and activity diagram. Areebah, Daniil and Aziz are still working on their diagrams but we have all definitely started just 'cleaning up'.  
- Quality requirements document - complete by David, Daniil and Areebah, Aziz is in progress but still needs to commit it to the repo.  
- Functional requirements are being used to make accurate Use Cases for UML diagrams.  
- Outside meeting minutes, Group stays in touch via WhatsApp groupchat as we progress with the tasks ensuring we all understand it and try to use the same format.

<summary>Key Decisions</summary>

- The group should be done with 3b by now but Areebah, Daniil and Aziz are not done yet so this is their main focus for this week.   
- Last week we decided UML diagrams Activity diagrams and quality requirements documents to be updated and uploaded to GitHub by Friday 17/10/25 - this has not been done by all members only David so we are pushing this deadline to 28/10.  
- Begin focusing on 4a.
- Github commits need to be regular with every task.

<summary>Discussion</summary>

- **Quality Requirements:**
  - Just waiting for David, Daniil and Aziz to commit these to GitHub.
  - Areebah has commited and is happy with this task being completed.
    
- **UML Diagrams:**
  - David says he is done with this task yet to export it from papyrus and commit it to Github. 
  - Daniil has exported his UML diagram from papyrus and commited it to Github but has agreed it needs more detail as suggested by professor.
  - A suggestion on adding a paragraph explaining the use cases in more detail for clarity.
  - Areebah has made 7 Use cases and started her UML diagram in papyrus just deciding on include and extend use cases other than the main 7 use cases.
  - Aziz is still focusing on his use cases - Areebah suggests he should look closely at the functional requirements for his subsytem as this is what helped her.
    
- **Activity Diagrams:**
  - Areebah has asked all members what their progress is.
  - David says he has done the diagram but is yet to commit it.
  - Daniil has started but still in progress
  - Areebah did start to draft last week but has decided to focus back on UML diagram again as she is still stuck on the extend and include use cases trying to not make the diagram too crowded, looking at lecture notes MobileShop example as guidance.
  - Aziz has yet started but is planning to and is keeping group updated when he does. 

- **GitHub Repository:**  
  - Areebah is asking that the group consistently uses GitHub making commits. She suggests that everyone starts and works on their task in GitHub rather than a word document so everyone can review and collab.
  - We can then make the pdf seperately individually.
  - Still need to maybe organise the GitHub differently, the branches. 

- **Preparation for next Week:**  
  - Ensure that at least both UML diagram and Activity diagram are done AND UPLOADED.  
  - Each member to review their use case and activity diagram before starting architectural design.
  - ensure we are looking at the markscheme as we do the tasks so that they are done correctly.

- some members are being a bit brief in their work - ensure detail and that it satisfies the markscheme.  
- GitHub commits are not consistent so we make sure that we work on taks in repo not word document.
