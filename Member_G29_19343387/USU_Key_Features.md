# USU Operation System – Key Features Overview

Explain how the key system features apply specifically to the USU Operation System (the web-based application for USU officers).

## KF-1: Dynamic Update of information
- Keeps USU officers informed about nationwide events, union participation, and student registrations.
- Event changes in other subsystems should automatically appear here with notifications for officers.

## KF-2: Services Across University-Specific Student Unions
- Supports coordination of events, promotion of events, exchange of info across multiple universities.
- Tracks participation, shares event successes, and provides tools for managing cross-union activities.
- coursework says

`This relies on collecting, storing, and processing a large volume of data from a large number of participating universities, societies and students. The system must be scalable to be used by all students at all universities in the UK.`

## KF-3: Automated Workflow
- Integrates with Student App, Union Management, and Society Leader subsystems.
- Ensures updates, approvals, and registrations flow automatically between subsystems.
- coursework says

` seamless processing of data covering a wide range of user activities, such as searching for available events and societies, booking tickets, set up events, commenting and ranking events and societies, etc. A workflow may involve different types of users. It must be integrated seamlessly`

## KF-4: User Experience
- Focused on USU officers using desktop or tablet.
- Interface should be clear, intuitive, and efficient for managing unions and nationwide events.


## KF-5: Security and Privacy Protection
- Protects sensitive data about unions, officers, and events.
- Implements access control so only authorised USU officers can view or modify data.
- Maintains privacy according to security best practices.
- coursework says

`A clear definition of the access permissions to various types of data must be implemented and maintained all the time. `


# USU Operation System – Key Features Overview

Explains how the main system features (KF-1 to KF-5) apply to my **USU Operation System** (the web app used by USU Officers to manage the national federation of student unions and coordinate activities between different universities)

## KF-1: Dynamic Update of Information

The USU Operation System needs to show live updates so officers always have the latest info about events, societies, and members. E.g. if a university union changes an event’s venue or time, the update should show up straight away on the USU dashboard without anyone having to refresh the page.

coursework sayas 
> “the system should dynamically update data and push the update to its registered users in real time.”

In my subsystem, that means things like event progress, ticket availability, or approvals will update automatically. It keeps everything accurate and up to date for the officers who are monitoring nationwide activities.

## KF-2: Services Across University-Specific Student Unions

One of the main jobs of the USU Operation System is to make it easy for different university unions to work together and share info. It should help manage big national events, promote local ones, and store a large amount of data from different universities.

coursework says  
> “This relies on collecting, storing, and processing a large volume of data from a large number of participating universities, societies and students. The system must be scalable to be used by all students at all universities in the UK.”

So this part of the system needs to be reliable and scalable enough to handle all that data while keeping things smooth and accessible for officers.

---

## KF-3: Automated Workflow

The USU Operation System connects with other subsystems (like the Student App, the Union Management System, and the Society Leader Portal) to make sure everything flows automatically. So if a student registers for an event, the USU officers should see that update instantly.

coursework says
> “Seamless processing of data covering a wide range of user activities, such as searching for available events and societies, booking tickets, setting up events, commenting and ranking events and societies… A workflow may involve different types of users. It must be integrated seamlessly.”

This means all the parts of the system should coordinate with each other easily without anyone having to move data manually.

---

## KF-4: User Experience

My subsystem will be used mainly on desktop or tablet, it needs to be easy to use and well-organised. The design should help officers quickly find what they need (like event info, member lists, or reports, without going through lots of menus)

The coursework mentions using modern tech like cloud computing and AI to make user experiences better. For the USU Operation System, that could mean personalised dashboards, automatic event recommendations, or even tools that help officers manage data more efficiently.

---

## KF-5: Security and Privacy Protection

My subsystem handles sensitive information about unions, officers, and events, it needs strong security controls. That includes logins, role-based access, and making sure data is encrypted and only seen by the right people.

coursework says
> “A clear definition of the access permissions to various types of data must be implemented and maintained all the time.”

So privacy and data protection are essential not just for safety, but also for keeping trust between universities and the national USU organisation.
